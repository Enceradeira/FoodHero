# Talker
An engine to drive a conversation with a user or some might it call a bot

## Vision
* Talker is inherently asynchronous
* Talker can be easily configured
* Talker knows 'context' and executes 'tasks'
* Supports linear, branching  and interrupted conversations
* Supports randomness
* Supports standard actions for errors
