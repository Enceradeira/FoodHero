Overview
-------

Allows testing of asynchronous APIs using XCTest much like [gh-unit](https://github.com/gabriel/gh-unit).

For questions or issues, please email [premosystems](https://github.com/premosystems).

Interested users should also check out [XCTAsyncTestCase](https://github.com/iheartradio/xctest-additions), another awesome async library for XCTest.

Install
-------

Add `XCTestCase+AsyncTesting.h` and `XCTestCase+AsyncTesting.m` to your project.

Usage
-----

1. Add `#import "XCTestCase+AsyncTesting.h"` to tests that need to be asynchronous.
2. Create your test cases as usual
3. Call `-waitForStatus:timeout:` or `-waitForTimeout:` after you start your asynchronous call
4. Call `-notify:` in your callbacks

See `AsyncXCTestingKitTests.m` for more information.

Known Problems
--------------

* Tests hang when run under XCode build bots
